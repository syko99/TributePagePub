        <h2>Birth of a Jinchuriki</h2>
        <p>Naruto was born a Jinchuriki of the Nine-Tailed Fox. His parents, Minato Namikaze (fourth Hokage) and 
            Kushina Uzumaki both died soon after his birth, saving him from being killed by the Nine-Tailed beast.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="history-panel-next history-panel2">
        <h2>Infancy</h2>
        <p>With no one to look after young Naruto, the third Hokage swore to look after the baby boy. However, this wasn't really the case.
             Baby naruto housed in Lord Third's home as an infant but was cared for by a nanny in a private room. He received little attention 
             and was kept secluded from most of the outside world.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="history-panel history-panel1">
        <h2>Early Childhood</h2>
        <p>By the time naruto was a young child, he was left to live on his own in a small apartment. 
            He lived alone in this apartment his entire childhood, eating mostly ramen noodles. The third Hokage would drop off some money every 
            month for the boy to make ends meet. He was giving Naruto a way to survive, but was not truly raising or 
        taking care of him. He only recieved the welfare checks because of the third Hokage's word to take care of the fourth Hokage's son. Almost no one
        else in his village knew of his bloodline, Naruto himself didn't even know. Being the Nine-Tails Jinchuriki, he always kept to 
        himself as he was looked down upon by everyone in the village as a monster child. Naruto was alone as a child.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="history-panel-next history-panel2">
        <h2>Late Childhood</h2>
        <p>Naruto was a pretty reckless child. He was almost living in his own world, doing whatever he pleased like running 
            throughout the village pulling pranks and bothering people. He was becoming infamous as a reckless kid, but deep down it was because he just wanted some kind of attention. 
        He did attend school which was called academy. During academy he was the same reckless kid, but he constantly tried to make friends and prove hisself by being very outgoing. 
        Fortunately, he was becoming pretty successful at connecting with others at his age, making friends in the academy mainly because of his inspiring motivation to keep improving
        despite his circumstances as a child..</p>

        <p>After graduating at the academy, young shinobi were to begin taking on missions to serve the village and provide a means of living. As Naruto 
            completed his missions, he had been making friends and building relationships all over many nations. He was also becoming a pretty powerful shinobi. Naruto's strengths began
        to develop as he got older, getting a grasp of his powers inherited from his parents. He began very intense training to become stronger and he had the ability to do so thanks to
        his strong dna. He was strong enough to save his entire village from destruction and had been deemed a hero. The power of the Nine-Tailed Fox was something that he had 
        little control of and mostly revealed itself through anger, boosting his own power but hurting himself in many ways. So naturally he hated it and tried his best to keep it under wraps.</p>
